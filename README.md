# Twin-Stick Shooter Game 1

A game heavily inspired by [Super Stardust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Stardust_HD) in a world with not enough good twin-stick shooters.

(This game uses keyboard and mouse so "twin-stick" is only to describe the genre.)

Code is pretty hacky, but at least the game is playable!

# IMPORTANT NOTE

Windows doesn't play nice with old OpenGL calls, so all the images being drawn are in reverse order, and also the alpha channel is interpreted incorrectly.

I didn't find a solution, so you'll just have to deal with it. This means the background isn't drawn, which is kind of a shame.

But, the source code is here, so you can manually reverse the draw order if you want!... Though alpha still won't be interpreted correctly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* If compiling from source, you'll want Visual Studio
* 2GHz+ CPU is probably enough
* ~100MB RAM
* No audio requirements
* **Windows-only** (but the source code is right here so try some stuff if you want to)
    * 32-bit only because Windows sucks, but don't fret, since 64-bit Windows can run 32-bit programs just fine

## Good twin-stick shooters

There's a clear lack of twin-stick shooters in the world. Here are some good ones. (PC-focus since I don't really know anything other than Super Stardust on console.)

* [Geometry Wars 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars_3:_Dimensions): haven't played this yet but it's considered the closest to Super Stardust on PC
* [Nex Machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nex_Machina): made by the same people who made Super Stardust! it's sad that the game didn't sell well so the developers don't work on twin-stick shooters anymore
* [Enter the Gungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Gungeon): more bullet hell than twin-stick shooter, but definitely good
* [Null Vector](https://store.steampowered.com/app/608110/Null_Vector/): the upgrade system was very well done, making the risk vs. reward thought process with each upgrade very meaningful

### Ones I haven't played but are considered good:

* [Nuclear Throne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Throne): considered very, very good
* [Ruiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruiner_\(video_game\)): considered very good
* [Neon Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Chrome): considered good
* [Chippy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/602700/Chippy/): considered good

## Special note: bad or meh twin-stick shooters

Some twin-stick shooters are just bad. It takes a lot of work to make a game, and it takes a lot of focus to make a twin-stick shooter good. These twin-stick shooters are not good due to various reasons.

* (Bad) [Nier Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nier:_Automata)'s hacking minigame: extremely simple, no depth, very repetitive; although it's just a minigame, so much more could have been done (also the base game wasn't great, but that's a different topic); also the driving force behind making this section
* (Meh) [Assault Android Cactus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_Android_Cactus): decent, but the variety comes from the different characters to play as, which isn't very fun, also somewhat repetitive
* (Meh) [PixelJunk Shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PixelJunk_Shooter): it's not an action-focused twin-stick shooter, which is why it doesn't capture my attention; however, the main gimmick was the particle effects on the brand-new PS3, not the twin-stick shooting
* (Bad) [Furious Angels](https://store.steampowered.com/app/551450/Furious_Angels/): cool concept, did not evolve beyond that; it's just shooting things until you die
* (Meh/Bad) [THOTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth_\(video_game\)): kinda hard, not much going on; pretty sure I a least completed it but it wasn't fun
* (Bad) [Tormentor X Punisher](https://store.steampowered.com/app/500670/TormentorPunisher/): takes too long for things to get interesting, and the upgrades were kinda annoying; also the name having the U+274C character in its name is so annoying
* (Meh) [Stardust Galaxy Warriors: Stellar Climax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamloop_Games#Games): actually, it's a shoot 'em up, which definitely isn't twin-stick shooting... but nothing felt powerful, and everything felt too old-school; however, I'm including this because the customization options and accessibility options are great
* (Bad) [Tokyo 42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_42): focuses more on the adventuring than the twin-stick shooting, but the isometric view makes aiming hard and shooting annoying, the stealth system was overused, and 100%ing it will not be fun
* (Good) [REVOLVER360 RE:ACTOR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/313400/REVOLVER360_REACTOR/): again, it's a shoot 'em up, but it's so freakin' cool; kinda hard but it's so interesting
* (Good) [Heat Signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_Signature_\(video_game\)): not really a twin-stick shooter but it's really good!
