# Twin-Stick Shooter Game 1

A game heavily inspired by [Super Stardust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Stardust_HD) in a world with not enough good twin-stick shooters.

(This game uses keyboard and mouse so "twin-stick" is only to describe the genre.)

Code is pretty hacky, but at least the game is playable!

# IMPORTANT NOTE

Currently doesn't compile. I'm moving a bunch of code over, so you'll have to wait.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites (TODO)

* If compiling from source, you'll want Visual Studio
* ?GHz+ CPU recommended
    * TODO
* ?MB RAM
    * TODO
* No audio requirements
* **Windows-only** (but the source code is right here so try some stuff if you want to)
    * 32-bit only because Windows sucks

## Twin-stick shooters I think are good

There's a clear lack of twin-stick shooters in the world. Here are some good ones. (PC-focus since I don't really know anything other than Super Stardust on console.)

* Geometry Wars 3 (haven't played this yet but it's considered the closest to Super Stardust on PC)
* Nex Machina (made by the same people who made Super Stardust! it's sad that the game didn't sell well so the developers don't work on twin-stick shooters anymore)
* TODO
